# **App Name**: Story Weaver

## Core Features:

- AI Story Generation: Generate unique children's stories based on user-provided themes, characters, and morals, using an LLM.
- Story Display: Present the generated story in a visually appealing format with clear sections for title, characters, plot, and moral of the story.
- Context-Aware Illustrations: Incorporate illustrations into the story by intelligently selecting and displaying relevant images or icons, that complement the text, with an AI tool that decides when or whether the images would improve the storytelling.
- Customization Options: Allow users to customize aspects of the generated story, such as length and reading level. The form inputs should feature sensible, limited ranges.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A soft, warm rose (#F28B82), evoking feelings of comfort and nostalgia, appropriate for children's stories.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated rose (#F8E7EB), complementing the primary without overpowering it, creating a calm visual base.
- Accent color: A muted, golden yellow (#D4AC0D), analogous to the primary color, used sparingly to draw attention to interactive elements.
- Use a playful yet readable font, such as Nunito, for the main text to make it appealing and easy for children to follow along.
- Incorporate whimsical, hand-drawn-style icons to represent different themes and morals, adding a touch of personality and fun.
- Maintain a clean and spacious layout with generous margins and padding to prevent visual clutter and enhance readability.
